# 05 Third-Party APIs: Work Day Scheduler

## Summary

For this assignment, I had to create a daily planner using jQuery.  For each business hour, the user can choose to input information, and save it to the planner for later review.  The user can also see what events have occured, are currently taking place, or about to ake place in the future, based on the current business hour.


## What I Have Accomplished
Using jQuery methods, I programmed a working clock that displays the current date and time, constantly updating by the second.  I also managed to get the planner to look somewhat like the example, without having write a ton of html (thank you jQuery?). Screenshots are available to display layout, and that time is updating.

## Shortcomings
I could not fgure out a way for the user data to be saved to each text area, as well as the localStorage.  More to work on.
